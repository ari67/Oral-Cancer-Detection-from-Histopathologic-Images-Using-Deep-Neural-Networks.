Oral cancer is a significant public health problem worldwide, with early detection and accurate diagnosis being critical factors for successful treatment. Globally, reports of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC), a prevalent type of cancer, have increased. Histopathological analysis of tissue samples is considered to be the gold standard in the diagnosis of OSCC, but the process is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and requires specialized expertise. Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), one of the emerging machine learning approaches, have a promising future in automating the identification and diagnosis of cancer using histopathological images. In this paper, two popular deep neural networks, SqueezeNet and GoogleNet, are used to detect OSCC from histopathology images. Each model was trained on different learning rates and their corresponding accuracies were noted. It was found that SqueezeNet gave higher validation accuracy.
